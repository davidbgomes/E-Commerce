# Oxyllus

## Overview

This is a ecommerce website done by myself while learning React.js and Node.js.
<br></br>
The core of the website is to sell one merch product at a time, and for each product sold, one tree will be planted.
<br></br>
Firebase was used for the database (Firestore), hosting, storage, and Cloud Functions, where the Node backend is hosted.
<br></br>
So far we only ship to Portugal.
